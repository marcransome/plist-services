# plist-services
`plist-services` comprises two Mac OS X services for quickly converting property list (.plist) files between XML and binary encodings.  The services are built with Automator and use the command-line `plutil` program to perform the conversion process.

## Installation
Installation is as easy as double-clicking each of the two files that are extracted from the download archive (click the `ZIP` icon at the top of this page to download).  You will be prompted to install the services individually and may alternatively open them in Automator for further customisation:

## Usage
The services can be accessed directly from the Finder's contextual menu by right-clicking on one or more .plist files:
