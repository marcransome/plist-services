# plist-services

`plist-services` comprises two Mac OS X services for quickly converting property list (`.plist`) files between XML and binary encodings. The services are built with [Automator](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/automator) and use the command-line `plutil` program to perform the conversion process.

## Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/marcransome/plist-services/releases) package, extract the files, then double-click each of the two workflow files in turn, accepting the installation prompts that will appear:
